AES - 128 bit (16 bytes) simetrycal bit cypher

AES Keys:
 - 128 (10 rounds of encryption)
 - 192 (12 rounds of encryption)
 - 256 (14 rounds of encryption)

Arranges bytes in 4x4 grid

Given input:
	b0 b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6 b7 b8 b9 b10 b11 b12 b13 b14 b15

Arranges them like this:

	b00 b04 b08 b12
	b01 b05 b09 b13
	b02 b06 b10 b14
	b03 b07 b11 b15

AES operations in one round:
 - Plaintext XOR part of the key
 - Substitute Bytes
 - Shift Rows
 - Mix Columns (except the last round)
 - Add round key (XOR)

Keys are expanded for every round of encryption

Substitute Bytes (S-BOX)
 - We go over each byte in our message and substitute it by a byte from the lookup table

Shift Rows:
 - We shift each row to the left except the first row
  - second row shift by one position
  - third row shift by two position
  - fourth row shift by three position
 - Together with the substitution this makes the data very messy and not recognizable

Mix Columns
 - Done using matrix multiplication
 - Take the columns and multiply them as a vector by a matrix
 - Produces a new column (which is a combination of all the columns) to replace the original one

Padding - Adds characters to a block if it is not equal to 16
Key - Fixed length key of 16, 24 or 32 bytes
Block Size - Specific block size used in block cyphers
(Algorith that encrypts a fixed size n bits of data at one time) (16 bytes)
Hashing - Complex mathematical calculation to map data of an arbitrate size to fixed length values


Example
 "I love Python More than anything in the world" (45 char)
 |I love Python Mo|re than anything| in the world|
      16 bytes         16 bytes       12 bytes
Each ASCII character is 8 bites aka 1 byte (actually 7 bits, but the last bit is used for error checking)
All the block have to be 16 bytes, so wee need to add characters to the last block
 |I love Python Mo|re than anything| in the world{{{{|
      16 bytes         16 bytes         16 bytes
This example is now correctly split into block

Mods of encryption in AES

Electronic Code Block:
Encryption Key: Hello
For example purposes lets assume all blocks show bellow ar bytes.
Key ==> |I love | Key ==> |Python| Key ==> |.Py|
          a6/xx            60f60/6         060
A pattern can be seen in the last two block = No good!

Cypher Block-chaining Mode
Encryption Key: Hello
IV - Random sequence of characters that is added to the first block.
     To produce a more unpredictable cypher text.
For example purposes lets assume all blocks show bellow ar bytes.
           IV (Initialization Vector)
            |
Key ==> |I love | Key ==> |Python| Key ==> |.Py|
                 +                +
                /                /
         a.s-01            =ar=0a          xx909

Result from the first block encryption is used to augment the cypher key for the next block.
And continuing like that for all blocks.
In this way not leaving any patterns in the cyphered text.
