AES - 128 bit (16 bytes) simetrycal bit cypher

AES Keys:
 - 128 (10 rounds of encryption)
 - 192 (12 rounds of encryption)
 - 256 (14 rounds of encryption)

Arranges bytes in 4x4 grid

Given input:
	b0 b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6 b7 b8 b9 b10 b11 b12 b13 b14 b15

Arranges them like this:

	b00 b04 b08 b12
	b01 b05 b09 b13
	b02 b06 b10 b14
	b03 b07 b11 b15

AES operations in one round:
 - Plaintext XOR part of the key
 - Substitute Bytes
 - Shift Rows
 - Mix Columns (except the last round)
 - Add round key (XOR)

Keys are expanded for every round of encryption

Substitute Bytes (S-BOX)
 - We go over each byte in our message and substitute it by a byte from the lookup table

Shift Rows:
 - We shift each row to the left except the first row
  - second row shift by one position
  - third row shift by two position
  - fourth row shift by three position
 - Together with the substitution this makes the data very messy and not recognizable

Mix Columns
 - Done using matrix multiplication
 - Take the columns and multiply them as a vector by a matrix
 - Produces a new column (which is a combination of all the columns) to replace the original one
